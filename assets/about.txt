My journey into computer science started with a simple Nintendo game boy. My interest in how games were made led me to programming and I read several articles on the subject. From simple sorting algorithms to specific programming languages like C++, Java, Javascript and C#, my passion for computer science intensified. I have created several personal projects in areas like computer networking, web development and machine learning.

My passion for computer science still remains but it is now more specifically focused on computer architecture. I am currently learning as much as I can on my own about how to build robust and performant software systems using various technologies like micro services and programming paradigms like AOP, OOP, functional programming, e.t.c. I would be glad to get an employment opportunity in which I can apply my knowledge at the moment and learn even more.
